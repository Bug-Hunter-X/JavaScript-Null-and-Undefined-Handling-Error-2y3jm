This repository contains a simple JavaScript example demonstrating a common error related to handling null and undefined values. The `bug.js` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access the 'length' property of a potentially undefined value. The solution uses a more robust check for null or undefined before attempting to access the 'length' property.
